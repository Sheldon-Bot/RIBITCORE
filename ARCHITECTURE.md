# RIBITCORE Architecture

This document describes the general layout of the RIBITCORE code - what goes where, what packages are responsible for, and how they connect.

Keep in mind this document is only a general layout, designed to get you introduced to the RIBITCORE codebase. This is not a replacement for examining the code yourself, rather, it should be used as an introduction on _how_ to examine the code.
